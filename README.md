RED RIGHT HAND - ALPHA-1

This plugin introduces an exciting new feature by adding a spawnable wave, enhancing gameplay and roleplaying experiences in unique ways. With this addition, players can enjoy increased variety and unpredictability during game sessions, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.

The plugin also includes a specialized command, forceo5wave, which allows admins to replace the upcoming MTF (Mobile Task Force) wave with the newly introduced wave. This command can be used strategically to alter the flow of the game, providing a tactical advantage or simply to introduce a new element of surprise.

Whether you're looking to challenge your friends with unexpected scenarios or create a more immersive roleplaying environment, this plugin offers the tools to do so. It's perfect for server admins who want to add an extra layer of complexity to their games.
